# Snake Game

A simple, classic Snake game built using Python and the Pygame library. Control the snake to eat the food, grow longer, and avoid running into walls or yourself!

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Just like the original Snake game.
- **Resizable Snake and Food**: Adjust the size of the snake and food as you wish.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score as you play.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aniket04087021/snake-game.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd snake-game
    ```
3. **Install the Pygame library**:
    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the game**:
    ```bash
    python snake_game.py
    ```

2. **Gameplay**:
    - Use the arrow keys (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) to control the snake's movement.
    - The objective is to eat the green food that appears on the screen.
    - Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and your score increases.
    - Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body; doing so will end the game.

3. **Restarting and Quitting**:
    - After losing, press `C` to play again or `Q` to quit the game.
